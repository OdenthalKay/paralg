Compiling and installing:

Just call "make" to compile everything.

To install you need "libFHBRS.h" somewhere in the search path for include files
and "libFHBRS.a" somewhere in the search path for library files.

A good idea for that is to copy the whole directory to /usr/local/libFHBRS.
Then make a soft link from /usr/local/include (in standard search path for include files)
and /usr/local/lib (in standard search path for library files) to the appropriate files.
I.e.:
cd /usr/local/include; ln -s ../libFHBRS/ibFHBRS.h .
cd /usr/local/lib;     ln -s ../libFHBRS/ibFHBRS.a .


===============================================================================
Some utility functions for C:

- timing functions
- random numbers
- some very simple graphic functions

See libFHBRS.h for a list of available functions.


===============================================================================
Timing:

Example for usage in C:
=======================
#include <libFHBRS.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  double t1, t2;

  t1 = gettime();
  t1 = gettime();
  t2 = gettime();
  printf("overhead getting time : %.6f s\n", t2-t1);
}

(If installed at /usr/local/libFHBRS):
cc -I/usr/local/libFHBRS test.c -L/usr/local/libFHBRS -lFHBRS -lX11 -lpthread
./a.out
